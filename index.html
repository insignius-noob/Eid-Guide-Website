        <span style="font-size: 30px; color: aliceblue">Eid</span> is a
        significant celebration in the Islamic calendar, marking the end of
        Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. There are two major Eids celebrated
        by Muslims: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.
      </p>
      <h2>Eid Al Fitr</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Timing: Celebrated at the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting.</li>
        <li>
          Significance: It marks the conclusion of a month of fasting and
          prayer, expressing gratitude to Allah for strength to complete it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Traditions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prayer: Special communal prayers are held in mosques or open areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Charity: Zakat al-Fitr, a form of charity, is given to those in need
          before the Eid prayer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Feasting: Families gather to share meals, often including sweets and
          traditional dishes.
        </li>
        <li>New Clothes: It's common to wear new or festive clothing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Eid Al Adha</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Timing: Occurs about 70 days after Eid al-Fitr, during the Islamic
          month of Dhu al-Hijjah, coinciding with the Hajj pilgrimage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Significance: Commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim
          (Abraham) to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God. It also
          celebrates the completion of Hajj.
        </li>
        <li>
          Religious Observance: The holiday emphasizes the values of sacrifice,
          charity, and gratitude. It reminds Muslims of their obligation to help
          those in need.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Traditions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Similar traditions of Eid Al Fitr are carried out along with some
          additionals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sacrifice (Qurbani): Families who can afford it will sacrifice an
          animal (commonly sheep, goats, cows, or camels) as a symbolic act of
          devotion. The meat is divided into three parts: one third is given to
          the needy, another third is shared with relatives and friends, and the
          remaining third is kept for the family.
        </li>
        <li>
          Feasting: After the sacrifice, families gather to share meals that
          often include the meat from the sacrifice, along with traditional
          dishes and sweets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Charity: Emphasis on helping those in need is particularly strong
          during Eid al-Adha, with many Muslims giving to charity (Zakat) before
          the holiday.
        </li>
